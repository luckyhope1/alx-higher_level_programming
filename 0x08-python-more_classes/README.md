Python - More Classes and Objects

---
### Resources

### Read or watch:

- Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- Class and Instance Attributes
- classmethods and staticmethods
- Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- str vs repr
